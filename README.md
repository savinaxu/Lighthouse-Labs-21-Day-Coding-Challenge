# Lighthouse-Labs-21-Day-Coding-Challenge
Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge! Over the next 21 days you’ll be travelling aboard the exploratory vessel ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy.  Just as you depart the solar system, a gigantic space bug knocks you off course! As the ISS Lighthouse captain, you’ll need to solve daily coding challenges to repair the ship and continue on your mission.  Remember: We only release ONE challenge a day but you can now catchup to the current challenge if you fall behind.  Click on the flashing radar below to start the first challenge. A new challenge will be unlocked every day at midnight PST. Complete all the challenges until the grid below is completely filled. Have fun!
